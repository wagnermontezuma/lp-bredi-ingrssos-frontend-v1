# Release Branch from PR #21

This repository clone does not have an `origin` remote configured, so the automated release steps could not fetch the PR merge reference. Below are the steps that were attempted and their outcomes:

1. `git stash -u` – skipped because no local changes were present.
2. `git fetch origin pull/21/merge:pr21-merge` – failed with `fatal: 'origin' does not appear to be a git repository` because no remote named `origin` exists in this environment.

To complete the release process once the remote is configured, follow these commands:

```bash
git fetch origin pull/21/merge:pr21-merge
git checkout -B release/pr21 pr21-merge
git push -u origin release/pr21
```

If the `main` branch must be reset to the merge commit from PR #21, ensure you have coordinated with collaborators and then run:

```bash
git checkout main
git branch backup/main-before-pr21
git reset --hard pr21-merge
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

Remember to verify that `origin` points to the correct remote repository before executing these commands.
